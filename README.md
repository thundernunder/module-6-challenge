ðŸ‘¦ Nathan Underwood - Module 5 Challenge

This Challenge gives me the opportunity to create a weather app using dynamic html, css, and javascript.

This was a difficult project for me, but I still enjoyed the project because of how much I learned. I won't be able to complete all the acceptance criteria before the due date, but I aim to complete the assignment and turn in after the due date so I can continue to learn functionality. I successfully used javascript to dynamically update the DOM with search history buttons using user input value. However, I am currently stumped on how to get the DOM to dynamically update with new weather data when the search history buttons are clicked. My goal was to continue adding user search values to an array and set that array in local storage. I accomplished this, but was unsuccessful in extracting any of the city values from the array in order to update the fetch request with the new city. My goal is to figure out a way to make that happen eventually!
