ðŸ‘¦ Nathan Underwood - Module 5 Challenge

This Challenge gives me the opportunity to create a weather app using dynamic html, css, and javascript.

This was a difficult project for me, but I still enjoyed the project because of how much I learned. I won't be able to complete all the acceptance criteria before the due date, but I aim to complete the assignment and turn in after the due date so I can continue to learn functionality. I successfully used javascript to dynamically update the DOM with search history buttons using user input value. This project also demonstrates my ability to fetch API data, and dynamically update HTML and CSS by creating a 5-day forecast, and saving user info to produce weather data when they click search history buttons. A future goal would be to include the required icon on the main weather card. Someday!
